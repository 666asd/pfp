Bitstream
=========

In order to implement the functionality that 010 editor has of treating
the entire stream as a bitstream, a stream-wrapping class (:any:`pfp.bitwrap.BitwrappedStream`) was made
to allow a normal stream to tread like a limited bit stream.

This may be useful in other applications outside of pfp.
